## Legal compliance

This project was developed entirely on personal time using personal devices. All contributors must confirm the same. Do not include any code derived from employer work product or code covered by an employment IP agreement.

## Code style

- Python 3.11+, no external formatter enforced (PEP 8 intent)
- No comments explaining *what* code does — only *why* when non-obvious
- No backwards-compatibility shims; change callers instead
- Tests for new traffic types and scenario fields are expected

## Pull requests

1. Fork and create a branch from `main`
2. Add tests if touching `agent/` or `controller/` logic
3. Run `uv run pytest` before opening PR
4. Reference the relevant scenario or hardware if the change is testbed-specific
